# Get a token

Before we begin, we must get the token from Lumia Stream.

Open Lumia Stream and continue through to connect all of your related connections.
Then you'll be brought to the `Dashboard`.
Once here you can head to `Settings` on the sidebar and scroll all the way down.
Here you'll find the `API` secion where you will be able to copy your token as well as having the ability to turn the API off or on.

Store this token as we will be using it later
