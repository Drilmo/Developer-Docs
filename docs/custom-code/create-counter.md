title: Create counter
---

You can set up a manual counter so that you can trigger multiple things based on the counter value

e.g. the code below will trigger a command named **'money-12'** when the **counter = 12**

```js
async function() {

	// You can get your variable's value that you just set here
	let redeemCount = await getVariable('redeemCount');

	if (!redeemCount) {
		// If variable does not exist it will create it
		redeemCount = await setVariable({ name: 'redeemCount', value: 10 });
	}

	redeemCount++;

	if (redeemCount === 12) {
			// call the command named money-12
			callCommand({ value: 'money-12' });
			// show a popup message in the Lumia stream app with '{{username}} is the 12th redeemer' inside
			showToast({ message: '{{username}} is the 12th redeemer' });
	}

	// always make sure this is the last line in the code otherwise your computer may get slower due to memory leaks
	done();
}
```

:::tip

**code blocks** like the one above ðŸ‘† have a copy button on the **top right corner** click it then paste in Lumia stream
