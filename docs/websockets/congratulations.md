# Congratulations!

You have just learned the **basics of the Websockets API** we're interested in seeing what you can make with this and excited to hear your feedback

Lumia Stream has **much more to offer**!

Check out our REST API if you haven't already to where you'll have the ability to send any command that you need to Lumia including the ability to trigger individual lights. Take a look at **[Rest](../rest/clone-the-repo.md)** to get started

Anything **unclear** or **buggy** in this tutorial? [Please report it!](https://forum.lumiastream.com/dev)
